---------------------------------

I am currently an Assistant Professor at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), jointly appointed in the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/) and affiliated with the [Siebel School of Computing and Data Science](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/).

I obtained my Ph.D. in the Department of [Computer Sciences](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), where I had the privilege of working with Prof. [Suman Banerjee](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~suman/) and Prof. [Somesh Jha](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jha/). Prior to that, I completed my M.S. at the [Courant Institute of Computer Science](https://www.cs.nyu.edu/) at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Anna University, Chennai, India](https://www.annauniv.edu/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Security & Privacy** and fields such as **Systems**, **Networking**, **Distributed Computing**, and **Machine Learning**. Specifically, my work focuses on understanding what private information can be inferred through interactions with machine learning models.
