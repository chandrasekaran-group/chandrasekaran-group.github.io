I graduated from the Department of Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I was fortunate to work with Suman Banerjee and Somesh Jha.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Security & Privacy and various domains such as Systems, Networking, Distributed Computing, and Machine Learning. In particular, my research aims to understand what private information can be inferred through interaction with a machine learning model.

Previously, I obtained my MS degree from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. I've obtained my B.Eng in Computer Science and Engineering from the College of Engineering, Guindy.
