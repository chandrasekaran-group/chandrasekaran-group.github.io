## Class Description

The course focuses on various aspects of data-centric security and privacy. Topics include applied cryptography, trusted base, privacy, anonymity, non-interference, information flow, intrusion detection, machine learning and security, password security, policy composition and analysis, formal approaches to specification and verification of secure systems, and security and privacy of emerging systems. Course Information: 3 undergraduate hours. 3 or 4 graduate hours. Prerequisites: CS 225. Additional prerequisites or corequisites may be specified each term.

**Learning Goals**: Identify and address privacy issues in online social networks; Apply machine learning to security and address adversarial machine learning; Use crypto constructs (homomorphic encryption, multi-party computation, etc.); Identify and address issues with de-identification; Use hardware designed to support trusted computing; Reason about information flow, computational security for encryption; Recognize threats and design mitigations for security in key sectors (e.g., healthcare); Understand architecture and recognize threats for smartphone security; Recognize issues with web privacy (especially tracking and advertising); Analyze human factors as they affect privacy and security; Recognize and reason about password security;

**Important Note**: The course assumes a basic knowledge of programming, computer systems, and statistics. The class will expect the ability to program in Python (primary), and Java (secondary)

## Expected Work

- **Participation**: Students are expected to attend all the lectures, participate in discussions, and attend (some) office hours (online/ offline). Please inform the instructor via email if you
  cannot make it to the class due to travel or sickness.

- **Machine Problems (MP)**: Students are expected to work on 5 MPs throughout the semester (**individual effort only**). The problems will involve hands-on programming and data analysis, covering various topics that complement the lecture topics. Example topics include tracking user location based on social network data, interacting with Bitcoin APIs, multi-party computation without directly exchanging data. All deadlines are 11:59 PM (CT) of the specific date.

## Policies

**Late Policy**: 
Please see the individual assignment instruction

**Academic Integrity**:
Students must follow the university's guidelines on academic conduct ([quick link](https://provost.illinois.edu/policies/policies/academic-integrity/students-quick-reference-guide-to-academic-integrity/)). This course will have a zero-tolerance policy regarding plagiarism. You should complete all the assignments and quizzes on your own. In this course, you can help your classmates with questions such as how to use the programming language, what the library classes or methods do, what the errors mean, and how to interpret the assignment instructions. You are encouraged to post such questions to the course discussion forum, and are also encouraged to answer questions posted to the forum from other students. However, you may not give or receive help from others (except the TA) with writing your program code or writing your answers for any of the assignments or tests. Do not show or share your program code with others, and do not view or copy source code from others. Students should not post their code in any publicly accessible locations. All electronic work submitted for this course will be archived and subjected to automatic plagiarism detection. Whenever in doubt, please seek clarifications from the instructor. Students who violate Academic Integrity policies will be immediately reported to the department and the college (which could leave a permanent mark on the transcript).

**Special Accommodations**: 
If you need special accommodations because of a disability, please contact the instructor in the first week of classes.

**Diminished Mental Health**:
Diminished mental health, including significant stress, mood changes, excessive worry, substance/alcohol abuse, or
problems with eating and/or sleeping can interfere with optimal academic performance, social development, and emotional
wellbeing. The University of Illinois offers a variety of confidential services including individual and group
counseling, crisis intervention, psychiatric services, and specialized screenings at no additional cost. If you or
someone you know experiences any of the above mental health concerns, it is strongly encouraged to contact or visit any
of the Universityâ€™s resources provided below. Getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do -- for yourself and for
those who care about you.
