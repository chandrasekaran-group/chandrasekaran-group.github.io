## Class Description

The course focuses on various aspects of data-centric security and privacy. Topics include applied cryptography, trusted base, privacy, anonymity, non-interference, information flow, intrusion detection, machine learning and security, password security, policy composition and analysis, formal approaches to specification and verification of secure systems, and security and privacy of emerging systems. Course Information: 3 undergraduate hours. 3 or 4 graduate hours. Prerequisites: CS 225. Additional prerequisites or corequisites may be specified each term.

**Learning Goals**: Identify and address privacy issues in online social networks; Apply machine learning to security and address adversarial machine learning; Use crypto constructs (homomorphic encryption, multi-party computation, etc.); Identify and address issues with de-identification; Use hardware designed to support trusted computing; Reason about information flow, computational security for encryption; Recognize threats and design mitigations for security in key sectors (e.g., healthcare); Understand architecture and recognize threats for smartphone security; Recognize issues with web privacy (especially tracking and advertising); Analyze human factors as they affect privacy and security; Recognize and reason about password security;

**Important Note**: The course assumes a basic knowledge of programming, computer systems, and statistics. The class will expect the ability to program in Python (primary), and Java (secondary)
