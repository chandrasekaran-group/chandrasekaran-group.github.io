## Class Description

Advanced topics in security and privacy problems in machine learning systems, selected from areas of current research such as: This section will primarily focus on using machine learning for system, networking, and security applications. Example topics include using ML to build novel security defenses (e.g., detecting network intrusions, cybercrime, and disinformation, and performing user authentication and vulnerability analysis), launch novel attacks (e.g., privacy attacks, password guessing, deepfake-based social engineering), and support system optimizations. We will explore new research directions and seek to understand the limitations and potential risks of ML-based approaches. Students will read, present, and discuss research papers, and work on an original research project. The goal of the project is to extend machine learning techniques to new problems and produce publishable results.

## Expected Work

- **Reading**: students will be reading and reviewing all the required papers, and participating in paper discussions during the class and over the online discussion board.
- **Participation**: students are required to attend all the lectures. Please inform the instructor via email if you cannot make it to the class due to travel or sickness.
- **Team Project**: 3-4 students will form a team to work on a single research project throughout the semester. The project should aim to solve a real problem in the intersection area of machine learning and security/system. Each team will write a project proposal, perform literature surveys, give a short talk in the midterm, and give a final presentation at the end of the semester. Each team is also expected to write up a final project report.
- **Paper Presentation**: students will present papers during the class to lead the discussion.

All deadlines are 11:59 PM (CT) of the specific date (not including paper reviews).
